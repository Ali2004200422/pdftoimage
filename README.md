# pdftoimage
It selects PDF files with HTML input and converts them to image files in the browser and allows you to quickly download all pdf pages together as a .zip file to your device. Since there is no server provider, the process ends very quickly. Libraries I use: pdf.js and jszip. You can also choose the picture quality.
